# What the heck is this?
I'm teaching myself machine learning from tutorials I find on the web.  This is a node/react/javascript solution to the Perceptrons ML problem presented on [applied go](https://appliedgo.net/perceptron/).  For added bonus, I've been livestreaming my learning process, on my twitch channel, [@irreverentmike](https://twitch.tv/irreverentmike)
# to run:
- This is based on `create-react-app`, so running is simple:
1. clone repo
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn start`

## Notes:
each time you refresh the page, the neural network will pick a new random line to train on, and run its training algorithms.  This isn't ideal: I'd like to be able to execute the ML code and adjust its inputs from the UI, but I found myself wasting time dealing with react/CRA rather than actually learning, so I stopped with all that.
